### Pause safely

**You own a clean stop. Leave a checkpoint a cold-start agent can resume from.** This is explicit only. On "keep going", "going to bed, keep going", or "don't stop", do not pause.

1. Stop at a safe boundary. Finish the current atomic step or back out of it. Start nothing new, and cancel any nested subagents.
2. Take no irreversible action to pause. No push, no tag.
3. Make the work durable. Commit uncommitted edits on `main` as one clear `wip:` commit so nothing is lost. It stays local, and the resuming agent reshapes it into verified units per **Committing** before anything is pushed. If the tree is broken, say so in the commit body in one line.
4. Write the resume note off-context. Capture intent, what you were doing, progress and what's verified, current state, next steps, key files, and gotchas. For the compaction trigger write it to a file like `/tmp/<slug>-resume.md`, and name that path in the `wip:` commit body. If a show-me-your-work trail exists, point at it instead of duplicating it.

**Reply:** where you are in the loop, what's on disk versus still in your head (paths, no diff dumps), the commits you made and whether the tree is clean, and the first action on resume. This is a pause, not a final report.
